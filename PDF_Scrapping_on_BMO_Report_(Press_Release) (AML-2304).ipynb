CautionThe foregoing section contains forward-looking statements. Please refer to the Caution Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.BMO Financial Group Second Quarter Report 2024 1(1)Results and measures in this document are presented on a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) basis. They are also presented on an adjusted basis that excludes the impact of certain specified items from reported results. Adjusted results and ratios are non-GAAP and are detailed for all reported periods in the Non-GAAP and Other Financial Measures section. For details on the composition of non-GAAP amounts, measures and ratios, as well as supplementary financial measures, refer to the Glossary of Financial Terms in our Second Quarter\\xa02024 Report to Shareholders.(2)Effective the first quarter of\\xa02024, the bank adopted IFRS\\xa017, Insurance Contracts (IFRS\\xa017), and retrospectively applied it to fiscal\\xa02023 results and opening retained earnings as at November\\xa01,\\xa02022. Forfurther information, refer to the Changes in Accounting Policies section in our Second Quarter\\xa02024 Report to Shareholders. (3)All EPS measures in this document refer to diluted EPS, unless specified otherwise. (4)The CET1 Ratio is disclosed in accordance with the Capital Adequacy Requirements (CAR) Guideline, as set out by the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (OSFI), as applicable.Note: All ratios and percentage changes in this document are based on unrounded numbers. \\x0cConcurrent with the release of results, BMO announced a third quarter\\xa02024 dividend of\\xa0$1.55 per common share, an increase of $0.04 or\\xa03% from the prior quarter and an increase of $0.08 or\\xa05% from the prior year. The quarterly dividend of $1.55 per common share is equivalent to an annual dividend of\\xa0$6.20\\xa0per common share. Second Quarter 2024 Performance Review Adjusted results and ratios in this section are on a non-GAAP basis. Refer to the Non-GAAP and Other Financial Measures section for further information on adjusting items. The order in which the impact on net income is discussed in this section follows the order of revenue, expenses and provision for credit losses, regardless of their relative impact. Canadian P&C Reported net income was $872\\xa0million, an increase of $53\\xa0million or\\xa06% from the prior year, and adjusted net income was $877\\xa0million, an increase of $55\\xa0million or\\xa07%. Results reflected a\\xa013% increase in revenue due to higher net interest income, driven by balance growth and higher margins, and higher non-interest revenue, partially offset by higher expenses and a higher provision for credit losses. U.S. P&C Reported net income was $543\\xa0million, a decrease of $188\\xa0million or\\xa026% from the prior year, and adjusted net income was $612\\xa0million, a decrease of $196\\xa0million or\\xa024%. On a U.S. dollar basis, reported net income was $398\\xa0million, a decrease of $141\\xa0million or\\xa026% from the prior year, and adjusted net income, which excludes amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, was $449\\xa0million, a decrease of $147\\xa0million or\\xa025%. Results reflected lower revenue due to a decrease in net interest income, primarily from lower margins, and lower non-interest revenue, lower expenses and a higher provision for credit losses. BMO Wealth ManagementReported net income was $320\\xa0million, an increase of $80\\xa0million or\\xa033% from the prior year, and adjusted net income was $322\\xa0million, an increase of $81\\xa0million or\\xa033%. Wealth and Asset Management reported net income was $252\\xa0million, an increase of $41\\xa0million or\\xa019%, and adjusted net income was $254\\xa0million, an increase of $42\\xa0million or\\xa019%, with higher revenue due to growth in client assets, including stronger global markets, partially offset by lower deposit balances and net interest margins. Insurance net income was $68\\xa0million, an increase of $39\\xa0million from the prior year, primarily due to changes in portfolio positioning during the transition to IFRS\\xa017. BMO Capital MarketsReported net income was $459\\xa0million, an increase of $89\\xa0million or\\xa024% from the prior year, and adjusted net income was $466\\xa0million, an increase of $88\\xa0million or\\xa023%. Results reflected higher revenue, primarily due to Global Markets driven by higher interest rate trading and higher debt and equity issuance activity, and lower expenses, partially offset by a higher provision for credit losses. Corporate Services Reported net loss was $328\\xa0million, compared with reported net loss of $1,131\\xa0million in the prior year, and adjusted net loss was $244\\xa0million, compared with adjusted net loss of $63\\xa0million. Reported results decreased, primarily due to the adjusting items noted above. Adjusted net loss increased due to lower revenue, driven by lower net accretion of purchase accounting fair value marks and the impact of treasury-related activities. Capital BMO’s Common Equity Tier\\xa01 Ratio was\\xa013.1% as at April 30, 2024, an increase from\\xa012.8% at the end of the first quarter of\\xa02024, driven by internal capital generation, common shares issued under the dividend reinvestment and share purchase plan and lower source-currency risk-weighted assets.Credit Quality Total provision for credit losses was $705\\xa0million, compared with a reported provision of $1,023\\xa0million and an adjusted provision of $318\\xa0million in the prior year. Adjusted provision for credit losses in the prior year excluded the initial provision on the purchased Bank of the West performing loan portfolio of $705\\xa0million. The provision for credit losses on impaired loans was $658\\xa0million, an increase of $415\\xa0million due to higher provisions across operating segments, reflecting the impact of a higher interest rate environment. The provision for credit losses on performing loans was $47\\xa0million, compared with a reported provision of $780\\xa0million and an adjusted provision of $75\\xa0million in the prior year. The $47\\xa0million provision for credit losses on performing loans in the current quarter was primarily driven by portfolio credit migration and uncertainty in credit conditions, partially offset by an improvement in the macro-economic outlook, including the adoption of a fourth economic scenario.

In this document, the names BMO and BMO Financial Group, as well as the words “bank”, “we” and “our”, mean Bank of Montreal, together with its subsidiaries. Caution Regarding Forward-Looking StatementsBank of Montreal’s public communications often include written or oral forward-looking statements. Statements of this type are included in this document and may be included in other filings with Canadian securities regulators or the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, or in other communications. All such statements are made pursuant to the “safe harbor” provisions of, and are intended to be forward-looking statements under, the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and any applicable Canadian securities legislation.

By their nature, forward-looking statements require us to make assumptions and are subject to inherent risks and uncertainties, both general and specific in nature. There is significant risk that predictions, forecasts, conclusions or projections will not prove to be accurate, that our assumptions may not be correct, and that actual results may differ materially from such predictions, forecasts, conclusions or projections. We caution readers of this document not to place undue reliance on our forward-looking statements, as a number of factors – many of which are beyond our control and the effects of which can be difficult to predict – could cause actual future results, conditions, actions or events to differ materially from the targets, expectations, estimates or intentions expressed in the forward-looking statements. The future outcomes that relate to forward-looking statements may be influenced by many factors, including, but not limited to: general economic and market conditions in the countries in which we operate, including labour challenges; the anticipated benefits from acquisitions, including Bank of the West, are not realized; changes to our credit ratings; the emergence or continuation of widespread health emergencies or pandemics, and their impact on local, national or international economies, as well as their heightening of certain risks that may affect our future results; cyber and cloud security, including the threat of data breaches, hacking, identity theft and corporate espionage, as well as the possibility of denial of service resulting from efforts targeted at causing system failure and service disruption; technology resiliency; failure of third parties to comply with their obligations to us; political conditions, including changes relating to, or affecting, economic or trade matters; climate change and other environmental and social risks; the Canadian housing market and consumer leverage; inflationary pressures; global supply-chain disruptions; technological innovation and competition; changes in monetary, fiscal or economic policy; changes in laws, including tax legislation and interpretation, or in supervisory expectations or requirements, including capital, interest rate and liquidity requirements and guidance, and the effect of such changes on funding costs and capital requirements; weak, volatile or illiquid capital or credit markets; the level of competition in the geographic and business areas in which we operate; exposure to, and the resolution of, significant litigation or regulatory matters, our ability to successfully appeal adverse outcomes of such matters and the timing, determination and recovery of amounts related to such matters; the accuracy and completeness of the information we obtain with respect to our customers and counterparties; our ability to execute our strategic plans, complete proposed acquisitions or dispositions and integrate acquisitions, including obtaining regulatory approvals; critical accounting estimates and judgments, and the effects of changes in accounting standards, rules and interpretations on these estimates; operational and infrastructure risks, including with respect to reliance on third parties; global capital markets activities; the possible effects on our business of war or terrorist activities; natural disasters and disruptions to public infrastructure, such as transportation, communications, power or water supply; and our ability to anticipate and effectively manage risks arising from all of the foregoing factors. We caution that the foregoing list is not exhaustive of all possible factors. Other factors and risks could adversely affect our results. For more information, please refer to the discussion in the Risks That May Affect Future Results section, and the sections related to credit and counterparty, market, insurance, liquidity and funding, operational non-financial, legal and regulatory, strategic, environmental and social, and reputation risk, in the Enterprise-Wide Risk Management section of BMO’s\\xa02023 Annual Report, and the Risk Management section in our Second Quarter\\xa02024 Report to Shareholders, all of which outline certain key factors and risks that may affect our future results. Investors and others should carefully consider these factors and risks, as well as other uncertainties and potential events, and the inherent uncertainty of forward-looking statements. We do not undertake to update any forward-looking statements, whether written or oral, that may be made from time to time by the organization or on its behalf, except as required by law. The forward-looking information contained in this document is presented for the purpose of assisting shareholders and analysts in understanding our financial position as at and for the periods ended on the dates presented, as well as our strategic priorities and objectives, and may not be appropriate for other purposes. Material economic assumptions underlying the forward-looking statements contained in this document include those set out in the Economic Developments and Outlook section of BMO’s\\xa02023 Annual Report, as updated in the Economic Developments and Outlook section and the Risk Management - Update on General Economic Conditions section in our Second Quarter\\xa02024 Report to Shareholders, as well as in the Allowance for Credit Losses section of BMO’s\\xa02023 Annual Report, as updated in the Allowance for Credit Losses section in our Second Quarter\\xa02024 Report to Shareholders. Assumptions about the performance of the Canadian and U.S. economies, as well as overall market conditions and their combined effect on our business, are material factors we consider when determining our strategic priorities, objectives and expectations for our business. In determining our expectations for economic growth, we primarily consider historical economic data, past relationships between economic and financial variables, changes in government policies, and the risks to the domestic and global economy. BMO Financial Group Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Release 3\\x0cNon-GAAP and Other Financial MeasuresResults and measures in this document are presented on a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) basis. Unless otherwise indicated, all amounts are in Canadian dollars and have been derived from our audited annual consolidated financial statements and our unaudited interim consolidated financial statements, prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board. References to GAAP mean IFRS. We use a number of financial measures to assess our performance, as well as the performance of our operating segments, including amounts, measures and ratios that are presented on a non-GAAP basis, as described below. Webelieve that these non-GAAP amounts, measures and ratios, read together with our GAAP results, provide readers with a better understanding of howmanagement assesses results. Non-GAAP amounts, measures and ratios do not have standardized meanings under GAAP. They are unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies and should not be viewed in isolation from, or as a substitute for, GAAP results. Certain information contained in BMO’s Management’s Discussion and Analysis dated May 29, 2024 for the period ended April 30, 2024 (Second Quarter 2024 Report to Shareholders) is incorporated by reference into this document. For further details on the composition of non-GAAP amounts, measures and ratios, including supplementary financial measures, please refer to the Glossary of Financial Terms section in our Second Quarter\\xa02024 Report to Shareholders which is available at www.sedarplus.ca.Our non-GAAP measures broadly fall into the following categories:Adjusted measures and ratios Management considers both reported and adjusted results and measures to be useful in assessing underlying ongoing business performance. Adjusted results and measures remove certain specified items from revenue, non-interest expense, provision for credit losses and income taxes, as detailed inthe following table. Adjusted results and measures presented in this document are non-GAAP. Presenting results on both a reported basis and anadjusted basis permits readers to assess the impact of certain items on results for the periods presented, and to better assess results excluding those items that may not be reflective of ongoing business performance. As such, the presentation may facilitate readers’ analysis of trends. Except as otherwise noted, management’s discussion of changes in reported results in this document applies equally to changes in the corresponding adjusted results. Tangible common equity and return on tangible common equity Tangible common equity is calculated as common shareholders’ equity, less goodwill and acquisition-related intangible assets, net of related deferred tax liabilities. Return on tangible common equity is commonly used in the North American banking industry and is meaningful because it measures the performance of businesses consistently, whether they were acquired or developed organically. Measures net of insurance claims, commissions and changes in policy benefit liabilities For periods prior to November\\xa01,\\xa02022, we presented adjusted revenue on a basis that is net of insurance claims, commissions and changes in policy benefit liabilities (CCPB), and our efficiency ratio and operating leverage were calculated on a similar basis. Measures and ratios presented on a basis net of CCPB are non-GAAP amounts. For more information, refer to the Insurance Claims, Commissions and Changes in Policy Benefit Liabilities section of the\\xa02023 Annual MD&A. Beginning the first quarter of\\xa02023, we no longer report CCPB given the adoption and retrospective application of IFRS\\xa017, Insurance Contracts (IFRS\\xa017). Caution This Non-GAAP and Other Financial Measures section contains forward-looking statements.

              " 'Concurrent with the release of results, BMO announced a third quarter\\xa02024 dividend of\\xa0$1.55 per common share, an increase of $0.04 or\\xa03% from the \\nprior quarter and an increase of $0.08 or\\xa05% from the prior year. The quarterly dividend of $1.55 per common share is equivalent to an annual \\ndividend of\\xa0$6.20\\xa0per common share. \\n\\nSecond Quarter 2024 Performance Review \\nAdjusted results and ratios in this section are on a non-GAAP basis. Refer to the Non-GAAP and Other Financial Measures section for further information \\non adjusting items. The order in which the impact on net income is discussed in this section follows the order of revenue, expenses and provision for \\ncredit losses, regardless of their relative impact. \\n\\nCanadian P&C \\nReported net income was $872\\xa0million, an increase of $53\\xa0million or\\xa06% from the prior year, and adjusted net income was $877\\xa0million, an increase of \\n$55\\xa0million or\\xa07%. Results reflected a\\xa013% increase in revenue due to higher net interest income, driven by balance growth and higher margins, and \\nhigher non-interest revenue, partially offset by higher expenses and a higher provision for credit losses. \\n\\nU.S. P&C \\nReported net income was $543\\xa0million, a decrease of $188\\xa0million or\\xa026% from the prior year, and adjusted net income was $612\\xa0million, a decrease \\nof $196\\xa0million or\\xa024%. \\n\\nOn a U.S. dollar basis, reported net income was $398\\xa0million, a decrease of $141\\xa0million or\\xa026% from the prior year, and adjusted net income, \\nwhich excludes amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, was $449\\xa0million, a decrease of $147\\xa0million or\\xa025%. Results reflected lower \\nrevenue due to a decrease in net interest income, primarily from lower margins, and lower non-interest revenue, lower expenses and a higher \\nprovision for credit losses. \\n\\nBMO Wealth Management\\nReported net income was $320\\xa0million, an increase of $80\\xa0million or\\xa033% from the prior year, and adjusted net income was $322\\xa0million, an increase \\nof $81\\xa0million or\\xa033%. Wealth and Asset Management reported net income was $252\\xa0million, an increase of $41\\xa0million or\\xa019%, and adjusted net \\nincome was $254\\xa0million, an increase of $42\\xa0million or\\xa019%, with higher revenue due to growth in client assets, including stronger global markets, \\npartially offset by lower deposit balances and net interest margins. Insurance net income was $68\\xa0million, an increase of $39\\xa0million from the prior \\nyear, primarily due to changes in portfolio positioning during the transition to IFRS\\xa017. \\n\\nBMO Capital Markets\\nReported net income was $459\\xa0million, an increase of $89\\xa0million or\\xa024% from the prior year, and adjusted net income was $466\\xa0million, an increase \\nof $88\\xa0million or\\xa023%. Results reflected higher revenue, primarily due to Global Markets driven by higher interest rate trading and higher debt and \\nequity issuance activity, and lower expenses, partially offset by a higher provision for credit losses. \\n\\nCorporate Services \\nReported net loss was $328\\xa0million, compared with reported net loss of $1,131\\xa0million in the prior year, and adjusted net loss was $244\\xa0million, \\ncompared with adjusted net loss of $63\\xa0million. Reported results decreased, primarily due to the adjusting items noted above. Adjusted net loss \\nincreased due to lower revenue, driven by lower net accretion of purchase accounting fair value marks and the impact of treasury-related activities. \\n\\nCapital \\nBMO’s Common Equity Tier\\xa01 Ratio was\\xa013.1% as at April 30, 2024, an increase from\\xa012.8% at the end of the first quarter of\\xa02024, driven by internal \\ncapital generation, common shares issued under the dividend reinvestment and share purchase plan and lower source-currency risk-weighted assets.\\n\\nCredit Quality \\nTotal provision for credit losses was $705\\xa0million, compared with a reported provision of $1,023\\xa0million and an adjusted provision of $318\\xa0million in \\nthe prior year. Adjusted provision for credit losses in the prior year excluded the initial provision on the purchased Bank of the West performing loan \\nportfolio of $705\\xa0million. The provision for credit losses on impaired loans was $658\\xa0million, an increase of $415\\xa0million due to higher provisions across \\noperating segments, reflecting the impact of a higher interest rate environment. The provision for credit losses on performing loans was $47\\xa0million, \\ncompared with a reported provision of $780\\xa0million and an adjusted provision of $75\\xa0million in the prior year. The $47\\xa0million provision for credit \\nlosses on performing loans in the current quarter was primarily driven by portfolio credit migration and uncertainty in credit conditions, partially offset \\nby an improvement in the macro-economic outlook, including the adoption of a fourth economic scenario. \\n\\nRefer to the Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgments section of BMO’s\\xa02023 Annual Report and Note\\xa04\\xa0of our audited annual consolidated \\n\\nfinancial statements for further information on the allowance for credit losses as at October\\xa031,\\xa02023.\\n\\n2 BMO Financial Group Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Release\\n\\n',\n",

We caution readers of this document not to place undue reliance on our forward-looking statements, as a number of \\nfactors – many of which are beyond our control and the effects of which can be difficult to predict – could cause actual future results, conditions, actions or events to differ materially \\nfrom the targets, expectations, estimates or intentions expressed in the forward-looking statements. \\n\\nThe future outcomes that relate to forward-looking statements may be influenced by many factors, including, but not limited to: general economic and market conditions in the \\ncountries in which we operate, including labour challenges; the anticipated benefits from acquisitions, including Bank of the West, are not realized; changes to our credit ratings; the \\nemergence or continuation of widespread health emergencies or pandemics, and their impact on local, national or international economies, as well as their heightening of certain risks \\nthat may affect our future results; cyber and cloud security, including the threat of data breaches, hacking, identity theft and corporate espionage, as well as the possibility of denial of \\nservice resulting from efforts targeted at causing system failure and service disruption; technology resiliency; failure of third parties to comply with their obligations to us; political \\nconditions, including changes relating to, or affecting, economic or trade matters; climate change and other environmental and social risks; the Canadian housing market and consumer \\nleverage; inflationary pressures; global supply-chain disruptions; technological innovation and competition; changes in monetary, fiscal or economic policy; changes in laws, including \\ntax legislation and interpretation, or in supervisory expectations or requirements, including capital, interest rate and liquidity requirements and guidance, and the effect of such \\nchanges on funding costs and capital requirements; weak, volatile or illiquid capital or credit markets; the level of competition in the geographic and business areas in which we \\noperate; exposure to, and the resolution of, significant litigation or regulatory matters, our ability to successfully appeal adverse outcomes of such matters and the timing, \\ndetermination and recovery of amounts related to such matters; the accuracy and completeness of the information we obtain with respect to our customers and counterparties; our \\nability to execute our strategic plans, complete proposed acquisitions or dispositions and integrate acquisitions, including obtaining regulatory approvals; critical accounting estimates \\nand judgments, and the effects of changes in accounting standards, rules and interpretations on these estimates; operational and infrastructure risks, including with respect to reliance \\non third parties; global capital markets activities; the possible effects on our business of war or terrorist activities; natural disasters and disruptions to public infrastructure, such as \\ntransportation, communications, power or water supply; and our ability to anticipate and effectively manage risks arising from all of the foregoing factors. \\n\\nWe caution that the foregoing list is not exhaustive of all possible factors. Other factors and risks could adversely affect our results. For more information, please refer to the \\ndiscussion in the Risks That May Affect Future Results section, and the sections related to credit and counterparty, market, insurance, liquidity and funding, operational non-financial, \\nlegal and regulatory, strategic, environmental and social, and reputation risk, in the Enterprise-Wide Risk Management section of BMO’s\\xa02023 Annual Report, and the Risk Management \\nsection in our Second Quarter\\xa02024 Report to Shareholders, all of which outline certain key factors and risks that may affect our future results. Investors and others should carefully \\nconsider these factors and risks, as well as other uncertainties and potential events, and the inherent uncertainty of forward-looking statements. We do not undertake to update any \\nforward-looking statements, whether written or oral, that may be made from time to time by the organization or on its behalf, except as required by law. The forward-looking \\ninformation contained in this document is presented for the purpose of assisting shareholders and analysts in understanding our financial position as at and for the periods ended on \\nthe dates presented, as well as our strategic priorities and objectives, and may not be appropriate for other purposes. \\n\\nMaterial economic assumptions underlying the forward-looking statements contained in this document include those set out in the Economic Developments and Outlook section of \\n\\nBMO’s\\xa02023 Annual Report, as updated in the Economic Developments and Outlook section and the Risk Management - Update on General Economic Conditions section in our Second \\nQuarter\\xa02024 Report to Shareholders, as well as in the Allowance for Credit Losses section of BMO’s\\xa02023 Annual Report, as updated in the Allowance for Credit Losses section in our \\nSecond Quarter\\xa02024 Report to Shareholders. Assumptions about the performance of the Canadian and U.S. economies, as well as overall market conditions and their combined effect \\non our business, are material factors we consider when determining our strategic priorities, objectives and expectations for our business. In determining our expectations for economic \\ngrowth, we primarily consider historical economic data, past relationships between economic and financial variables, changes in government policies, and the risks to the domestic and \\nglobal economy. \\n\\nBMO Financial Group Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Release 3\\n\\n',\n",
              " 'Non-GAAP and Other Financial Measures\\n\\nResults and measures in this document are presented on a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) basis. Unless otherwise indicated, all \\namounts are in Canadian dollars and have been derived from our audited annual consolidated financial statements and our unaudited interim \\nconsolidated financial statements, prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), as issued by the International \\nAccounting Standards Board. References to GAAP mean IFRS. We use a number of financial measures to assess our performance, as well as the \\nperformance of our operating segments, including amounts, measures and ratios that are presented on a non-GAAP basis, as described below. We\\nbelieve that these non-GAAP amounts, measures and ratios, read together with our GAAP results, provide readers with a better understanding of how\\nmanagement assesses results. \\n\\nNon-GAAP amounts, measures and ratios do not have standardized meanings under GAAP. They are unlikely to be comparable to similar measures \\n\\npresented by other companies and should not be viewed in isolation from, or as a substitute for, GAAP results. \\n\\nCertain information contained in BMO’s Management’s Discussion and Analysis dated May 29, 2024 for the period ended April 30, 2024 (Second \\nQuarter 2024 Report to Shareholders) is incorporated by reference into this document. For further details on the composition of non-GAAP amounts, \\nmeasures and ratios, including supplementary financial measures, please refer to the Glossary of Financial Terms section in our Second Quarter\\xa02024 \\nReport to Shareholders which is available at www.sedarplus.ca.\\n\\nOur non-GAAP measures broadly fall into the following categories:\\n\\nAdjusted measures and ratios \\n\\nManagement considers both reported and adjusted results and measures to be useful in assessing underlying ongoing business performance. Adjusted \\nresults and measures remove certain specified items from revenue, non-interest expense, provision for credit losses and income taxes, as detailed in\\nthe following table. Adjusted results and measures presented in this document are non-GAAP. Presenting results on both a reported basis and an\\nadjusted basis permits readers to assess the impact of certain items on results for the periods presented, and to better assess results excluding those \\nitems that may not be reflective of ongoing business performance. As such, the presentation may facilitate readers’ analysis of trends. Except as \\notherwise noted, management’s discussion of changes in reported results in this document applies equally to changes in the corresponding adjusted \\nresults. \\n\\nTangible common equity and return on tangible common equity \\n\\nTangible common equity is calculated as common shareholders’ equity, less goodwill and acquisition-related intangible assets, net of related deferred \\ntax liabilities. Return on tangible common equity is commonly used in the North American banking industry and is meaningful because it measures the \\nperformance of businesses consistently, whether they were acquired or developed organically. \\n\\nMeasures net of insurance claims, commissions and changes in policy benefit liabilities \\n\\nFor periods prior to November\\xa01,\\xa02022, we presented adjusted revenue on a basis that is net of insurance claims, commissions and changes in policy \\nbenefit liabilities (CCPB), and our efficiency ratio and operating leverage were calculated on a similar basis. Measures and ratios presented on a basis \\nnet of CCPB are non-GAAP amounts. For more information, refer to the Insurance Claims, Commissions and Changes in Policy Benefit Liabilities section \\nof the\\xa02023 Annual MD&A. Beginning the first quarter of\\xa02023, we no longer report CCPB given the adoption and retrospective application of IFRS\\xa017, \\nInsurance Contracts (IFRS\\xa017). \\n\\nCaution \\nThis Non-GAAP and Other Financial Measures section contains forward-looking statements. Please refer to the Caution Regarding Forward-Looking \\nStatements. \\n\\n4 BMO Financial Group Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Release\\n\\n',\n",
